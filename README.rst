Overview
========

This package provides an AJAX browser for Plone sites.

It uses the column browsing metaphor of OSX finder.

The intention was to speed up content management issues, and fast content
browsing in Plone.

Installation
============

- Make egg available in your Plone site
- Apply corresponding GS profile


Restrictions
============

If you want to browse Dexterity contents, consider to provide a UID by your
dexterity types in order to make them work with finder.


Usage
=====

After installation you have a link named 'Finder' at the top right of your
plone site. This link is provided by a viewlet and is positioned absolute. Use
CSS of your theme to put it wherever you like.

The finder gets displayed with focus on trigger context by clicking this
link.


Development and evaluation
==========================

you can checkout and install from source code. Plone 4 buildout configuration
is included.

    git clone git@github.com:collective/bda.plone.finder.git
